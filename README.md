Error: Missing expected argument '<dir>'

USAGE: strings-tool <dir> <name> [--check-missing-key]

ARGUMENTS:
  <dir>                   Path that contains the .lproj directory
  <name>                  Strings file name

OPTIONS:

```

Example usage:

`.build/release/StringsTool /Users/jimmyli/sources/c2iphone/Apps/Consumer/Resources Localizable.strings`

## What errors are checked

### NoStringsFileError

If {file}.strings is missing in any subdirectory

### DuplicatedKeyError

If the same keys are found in one strings file.

### MissingKeyError

If a key that is presented in any other language is missing.

Checking this error is disabled by default.

This is assuming every language should have every string translated, and do not use fallback. However, if we are ok to use fallback translation, we should disable this check
